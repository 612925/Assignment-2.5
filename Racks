Racks in Hadoop cluster:

Racks are there in hadoop clusters for proper arrangement.They consist of slave machines with a rack switch at the top of each rack.
It is  a collection of many nodes that are connected to the same network rack switch.This implies that all the nodes are rack-aware.
The network bandwidth between two nodes on different racks is less than the network bandwidth between between two nodes on the same rack.
Racks are useful for checking for replication and fault tolerance.This is done by replicating the data 
of one node on another node in a different rack in the form of blocks.A pipelime is built in this same manner.
