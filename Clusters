Clusters:
A cluster is a group of computers that work under the supervision of a big data technology.
These clusters enable high availability and share resources to support parallel processing and storage requirements.

Hadoop Clusters:
Hadoop cluster is a type of cluster used for storing and analyzing large datasets. 
These data may be structured or unstructured.A hadoop cluster consists of low cost commodity computers,
unlike high end servers.It follows master slave architecture,one machine is designated as Name Node and 
other commodity nodes are called job trackers/Datanode.
Hadoop cluster increases the speed of analyzing data and makes it manageable.
